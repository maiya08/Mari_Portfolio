### Biography
I taught myself how to draw out of frustration that movies ended (the show must go on!). This practice led me to friends who requested pop culture art, portraits, and comics. It was smooth sailing until this horrible beast called Algebra stepped into my world. All of a sudden I had to focus on grades and standardized testing. I started failing miserably.

I loved people,
and I was passionate about being in the action.

I taught myself how to draw out of frustration that movies ended **(the show must go on!)**. This practice led me to friends who requested pop culture art, portraits, and comics. It was smooth sailing until this horrible beast called Algebra stepped into my world. All of a sudden I had to focus on grades and standardized testing. *I started failing miserably.*

In 7th grade, I was tested for reading comprehension and the results stated that I was at a 3rd grade reading level.

My self-esteem took an unprecedented blow. I was still catching up to the fact that I was being tested. I hadn't understood the purporse for its application. Consequently, my performance remained poor. I was confused and unmotivated.

When misjudgments about a past head injury became the running criticism to explain my failures, I decided to learn the system to prove mental competence. I started to ask questions, practice examples, observe the processes.
I learned to talk to my teachers and participated in discussions.

I rose up to the Honor Roll, got into the Honor Society, and raised my GPA to its capacity of 4.1.

My peers elected me as their high school President, Vice President, and Class Representative.
My guidance counselor even assigned me to volunteer as an after-school tutor.
I graduated as summa cum laude and valedictorian from high school and college.

> "The question is not what you look at, but what you see." - Henry David Thoreau

> “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.” - Marianne Williamson
